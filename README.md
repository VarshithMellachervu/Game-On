# Game-On
Game On is a repository that includes three classic games—TIC-TAC-TOE, BRICK BREAKER, and SNAKE GAME—developed using Java GUI Swing. Each game brings back a nostalgic feel with a modern touch. 
In TIC-TAC-TOE, two players take turns marking spots on a 3x3 grid, trying to line up three in a row. 
BRICK BREAKER is an arcade game where you control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks, aiming to clear them all. 
The SNAKE GAME involves guiding a growing snake to eat food while avoiding crashes into walls or its own body. 
These games, created with Java Swing, offer a user-friendly and interactive experience that works on any platform with Java.
